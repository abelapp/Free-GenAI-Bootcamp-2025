¡Hola! Let's help you translate this sentence step by step.

Let's break down the vocabulary first:

| English | Spanish |
|---------|---------|
| bear    | oso     |
| door    | puerta  |
| garbage | basura  |
| to be   | estar   |
| to leave| dejar   |

Now, let's look at the sentence structure:
1. First part: "[The bears] [are] [at the door]"
2. Second part: "[Did] [you] [leave] [the garbage] [out]?"

Some hints:
- For "bears" you'll need the plural form of "oso"
- "are" needs the present tense of "estar" for plural subjects
- "did you leave" will use the past tense
- "at the door" uses the preposition "en" in Spanish

Would you like to try forming the first part of the sentence?
